    <p>Welcome to a world filled with the magic of friendship! The Mane 6 are a group of pony friends who always stick
      together on adventures through the town of Ponyville, the world of Equestria, and beyond.

    <p>Inspired by the
    animated television series, My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, the Meet the Mane 6 Ponies Collection includes
    these favorite pony figures: Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Applejack. They are sculpted with character-inspired expressions and signature poses. This collection is a great
      introduction for My Little Pony beginners to grow new friendships within a beloved brand. My Little Pony and
      all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.</p>
