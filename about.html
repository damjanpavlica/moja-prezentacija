    <p>Welcome to a world filled with the magic of friendship! The Mane 6 are a group of pony friends who always stick
      together on adventures through the town of Ponyville, the world of Equestria, and beyond. Inspired by the
      animated television series, My Little Pony Friendship is Magic, the Meet the Mane 6 Ponies Collection includes
      these favorite pony figures: Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Applejack.
      They are sculpted with character-inspired expressions and signature poses. This collection is a great
      introduction for My Little Pony beginners to grow new friendships within a beloved brand. My Little Pony and
      all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.</p>
